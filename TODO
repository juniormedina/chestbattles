#TODO: 
#Change animations for centered message. Ex: Constant flash only when waiting for input. Flash once when its a transitional phase (Draw Phase)

- Socket.io Client
    Lobby displays:
        Rooms that are available to join.
        Create room option. 

- Socket.io Server
    When clients connect, send list of rooms.
    and add client to list of users in lobby. (Used to update the clients when a new room is available and to show # of clients connected)



    






























    -- Setting Percentages to the cards in hand. Last card has 110px, calculate the percentages for the rest of the cards after
        deducting the 110px.
    - Get absolute position of card field and store it in a state or global variable.
    - Use the position to transition a card to the location when selected
    - make the card appear in the card field after it finishes its animation
        - meaning, show cards in cardfield; just like before.



When player is in counter phase, gray out/disable cards that aren't eligible.
- if no cards are eligible then continue automatically.
on either Counter phase, check if either playerhands are empty, if so, game is over and winner is selected. 
- if both hands are empty, its a draw.

Ideas:

Maybe: Change actionCreator for spUse to do an animation before sending the update to the store/reducer.


Phases 
    - Use
    - Counter
    - Discard



- Maybe Create different modes, Easy, Normal, Hard. 
    Easy = Picks worse card, skips counters randomly. Discards at random.
    Normal = random cards, no counter skips. Discards at random.
    Hard = picks best card, no counter skips. Discards worst cards.
